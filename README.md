This project implements an Evolution Strategy (ES) algorithm to solve the sphere shifted function and Schwefel function.

It is submitted as part of the coursework for the Evolutionary Computation subject in the Masterâ€™s program in Artificial
Intelligence Research at UNED.

The primary objective of this task is to gain a deeper understanding of how ES functions, the various steps
involved, and how hyperparameters (e.g., mutation parameters) influence both in the convergence
and the quality of the solution.

The file constants.py allows users to modify the hyperparameter values and adjust the distribution of cities within the
search area.

Additionally, the ES can be easily adapted to optimize other function.
